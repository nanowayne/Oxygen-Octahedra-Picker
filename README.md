# Oxygen-Octahedra-Picker
A software tool to extract quantitative information from STEM (HAADF-ABF) images. It was written in Digital Micrograph (DM, Gatan Inc) scripting language as a DM plugin. Center-of-mass and 2D Gaussian fitting methods were implemented to locate positions of individual atom columns. It enables mapping of atomic column positions from HAADF and ABF images and quantification of both crystal lattice and BO6 octahedral distortions.
